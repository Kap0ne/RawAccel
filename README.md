# RawAccel
RawAccel is a Windows x86-64 program which allows for the acceleration of mouse input in the raw input stream. RawAccel only modifies mouse input by a constant set of formulas and adds a one second delay when changing settings in order to ensure you don't get banned for using it (it's completely safe!).
